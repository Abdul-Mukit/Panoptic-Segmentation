Webpages that I used for installing necessary stuff.  

### CUDA
* [Link](https://askubuntu.com/questions/799184/how-can-i-install-cuda-on-ubuntu-16-04). !!!!! Don't install
the drivers using this method. Read the page first. Say "No" when the process asks to install drivers.  
* In case you installed drivers and can't log back in then browse down and follow the instructions commented by Alex.  

### cuDNN
[GihHub](https://askubuntu.com/questions/767269/how-can-i-install-cudnn-on-ubuntu-16-04). The isntallation was pretty simple.
